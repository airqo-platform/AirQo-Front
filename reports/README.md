# Auto Report Generator

Welcome to the Auto Report Generator project! This application is built using React, TypeScript, and Vite. It provides a streamlined setup to kickstart your development process, including Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for a seamless development experience and a set of basic ESLint rules to ensure code quality.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js version 18.19.1 or higher
- Yarn version 4.1.1

## Plugins

The template currently uses two official plugins:

- @vitejs/plugin-react: This plugin uses Babel for Fast Refresh.
- @vitejs/plugin-react-swc: This plugin uses SWC for Fast Refresh.

## ESLint Configuration

The template comes with a basic ESLint configuration. If you are developing a production application, we recommend expanding the configuration to enable type-aware lint rules. Here's how you can do it:

## Getting Started.

To get started with this template, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
yarn install

Then, you can start the development server:

yarn dev

Open http://localhost:5173 to view your application in the browser. The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.
