                  without limitation, air quality sensing technologies, digital
                  air quality platforms and tools, web and mobile apps for
                  accessing, understanding and interpreting air quality.

                  When you use our services, we may collect information to help
                  us improve and customize our products to better meet the needs
                  of our users. We may collect this information explicitly or
                  automatically using available third-party tools. AirQo is

                  This policy was developed to help you understand the
                  information we collect and the measures we put in place to

                  When you sign up to use our air quality digital platforms
                  including mobile and website apps and platform analytics, we
                  ask you to provide certain information such as name, phone
                  number, email address and password. The information collected
                  is used to set up and manage the user's account on our digital
                  platforms. We use contact information such as phone and email
                  to communicate with you.

                  When you agree to be a host of air quality monitoring devices,
                  we may collect personal information such as name and phone
                  number. Additionally, we may also collect metadata including
                  photos’ demographic and description of the site as well as
                  geolocation information. We use this information to support
                  the maintenance and management of the air quality network. Our
                  air quality monitoring devices collect location information
                  which helps us to associate air quality measurements with
                  specific locations.

                  We may also collect data through voluntary surveys to
                  understand user experiences and inform improvements. We may
                  commission studies and surveys to collect data to help us
                  understand users' perceptions and behavior on air quality
                  management. We use this information to help link air quality
                  information to action and policies to help improve air
                  quality. We also use this data to measure our impact. We
                  aggregate the information from surveys to remove any personal
                  identifying data.

                  such as Google Analytics, iOS and Android analytics. This
                  information helps us to understand usage patterns and inform

                  can help us fix bugs and improve performance resulting in a
                  better user experience.
